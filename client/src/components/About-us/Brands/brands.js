        Some WMF stainless products produced in Germany after World War II are
        called &#8243;Fraser&#8242;s
        WMF&#8242; because they were distributed in the United States by Fraser&#8242;s Ltd. of
        New York, a
        retail outlet founded by Gordon Freeman Fraser in Berkeley, CA, in 1947. Fraser&#8242;s
        grew to
        become a division of WMF of America, Inc., a subsidiary of WMF AG. With the death of
        Gordon
        Fraser in 2005, Fraser&#8242;s ceased to exist, and WMF products are now distributed in
        the U.S.
        by WMF Americas Group of North Carolina.

        Since 1998 the German cooking pan manufacturer Silit also belongs to the WMF Group. Silit
        is still marketed as an independent brand. In 2002, the range of products is rounded off
        by
        the acquisition of Kaiser Backformen.
